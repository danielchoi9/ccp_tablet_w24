    <p class="preword">Hello! My name is Daniel Choi, a first year student for Michigan's MSI program. I'm currently going through the UI/UX track. I got my undergraduate degree from Michigan as well, in biopsychology and neuroscience. This is my test website for SI 539, and I'm excited to learn more in the future!</p>

    <p>Most of my professional experiences have actually been in education and teaching, although I'm looking to get started in a more technology-focused work environment soon. I still love teaching, however, and I'd love to be a lecturer or professor in the future!</p>

    <p>I have a wide array of hobbies. Working out is definitely my favorite one, but in my spare time, I also paint, watch shows and movies, play games, and cook!</p>

    <p>I'm looking forward to learning a lot of new things this year. I am a little nervous about diving into a completely different field of study, but I'm sure that with hard work I'll be able to keep up.</p>

    <p>Here some pictures from my senior spring break trip in Cancun:</p>
